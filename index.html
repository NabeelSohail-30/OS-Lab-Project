                <p>Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing. As
                    the term is generally used, time slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in
                    equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority (also known as cyclic
                    executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin
                    scheduling can also be applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in
                    computer networks. It is an operating system concept.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
                <p>First-fit is a memory allocation algorithm using a linked list data structure. It sequentially
                    traverses the list of available memory blocks until it finds one that is large enough to satisfy
                    the request. It then allocates the process to that memory block. The size of the allocated block is
                    then reduced by the amount requested, and the address of the newly allocated block is returned to
                    the process. If the process does not fit in any of the available blocks, it is added to the list of
                    waiting processes. When a process completes, it releases its memory block, which is then merged
                    with any adjacent free blocks in memory.</p>
